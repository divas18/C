				Sieve of Eratosthenes

The problem with the sieve of Eratosthenes is not the number of operations it performs but rather its memory requirements.
For large n, the range of primes may not fit in memory; 
worse, even for moderate n, its cache use is highly suboptimal. The algorithm walks through the entire array A, exhibiting almost no locality of reference.
